# keystroke_dynamics_tfg_100429115
This repository belongs to the 2022/2023 TFG of UC3M student Adri√°n Serrano Navarro (100429115). It is related with biometric authentication based on keystroke dynamics. 


Keystroke_TFG directory contains the keystroke classification Python program that runs the tests considered. Inside it you can see a main file, a dataset directory with the original datasets and a classifier directory with each of the algorithms used in the classification process. 

The excel files contain the associated results of the different tests ran. Dns2009 include the tests made over the dns2009 dataset, Greyc-nislab over the Greyc-nislab dataset and so on. Each excel file has 5 different sheets, each one for each of the 5 algorithms proved.
